type alias Path =
    List Position


{-| Find a path between the `start` and `end` `Position`s. You must
  supply a cost function and a move function.

  The cost function must estimate the distance between any two
  positions. It doesn't really matter how accurate this estimate is,
  as long as it *never* overestimates.

  The move function takes a `Position` and returns a `Set` of possible
  places you can move to in one step.

  If this function returns `Nothing`, there is no path between the two
  points. Otherwise it returns `Just` a `List` of steps from `start`
  to `end`.

  Example usage.

     import AStar exposing (..)


     type World =
         ...your custom code...


     movesFrom : World -> Position -> Set Position
     movesFrom world (x,y) =
         ...your custom code...


     findPath
         straightLineCost
         (movesFrom currentWorld)
         ( 0, 0 ) ( 2, 0 )
     --> Just [ ( 1, 0 ), ( 2, 0 ) ]
