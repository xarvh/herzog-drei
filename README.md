# Herzog Drei

[Herzog Zwei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herzog_Zwei) was probably the very
first [RTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy).

I wanted to try my hand at a similar game, but my design goals are a bit different:

- Runs in the browser, so everyone can play

- Supports up to 8 players, if your browser can deal with 8 gamepads.
(For now it's single player only tho, keyboard and mouse)

- It's easy to learn and hard to master. Newbies welcome. =)

I'm coding it entirely in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), I want to see how I deal
with interactions in a flat entity hierarchy with a purely functional
language.
